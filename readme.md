Project Requirements Documentation
===================================
##### Created by Mitchell Sweet, Caitlyn Daly and Yang Jin


## Team Members and Roles
* __Project Manager__ - __*Caitlyn*__  - accounts for overall coordination of project, checking in with members, planning meetings, monitoring deadlines, and ensuring that work is steadily progressing.
* __Document Writer__ - __*Yang*__ - responsible for the non-code documents with the project. This person is responsible for planning document in both formats which including markdown version and Google Doc version.  Document writer would be account for file formatting, proofreading, and overall quality checking of written submissions. 
* __Documentation Writer__ - __*Caitlyn*__ - responsible for the code's documentation with the project: comments, headers, formatting, and help resources. The documentation also includes programs that are required to run the program, the way to compile the programs, the way to run the application and the way code works.
* __Application Designer__ - __*Yang*__ - responsible for the design of the application, especially the client side. The design including the diagram, explanations of the design and the reasoning of the pattern. The overall quality of the design will be determined with the decision of other group members and the designer. 
* __Application Programmer(s)__ - __*Mitchell*__ - responsible for the creation of the program. Application programmers are responsible for the coding part of the application. Other two members also have responsibilities to help write out the code which follow the design and purpose of the application.
* __Application Tester__ - __*Caitlyn*__ - responsible for testing the final creation: mainly writing unit tests and any documentation needed to accompany that. Every changes would be discuss within the group. 


## Deliverables
   A messaging program that communicate with the server side and the client side concurrently. The result of the communication is to tell the user how the application connect to the network and send the message over. 


## Project Needs
the project needs:
 * A multi-threaded messaging program that is client and server based.
 * A server program and a client program that can be run multiple times concurrently.
 * To have communications with both TCP/IP and UDP
 

## Project Requirements
The project must: 
* Allow the user to choose the type of communication that they would like to use
* Allow the user to see the interaction of how the messages are passing back and forth
* Allow the user to use a GUI
* Display the information when the client connects and disconnects
* Allow multiple clients connect at the same time
* Have instructions for the user
* Have documentations for the system administrator
* Have the jar file for fast access

## Milestones
**Assuming meeting-up every Thursday**
1. **Requirement Review - 10/5** - Requirements are complete, detailed, and suitable for the design
2. **Design  - 10/12** - Design for the code flow, server side, client side and interface are all completed, reasonable and all agreed within the team. 
3. **Pseudocode - 10/19** - All of the basic logic is thought out and documented. Part one of the project would be finished and submitted at this point. (Part one is due October 24th 8am)
4. **Server Completed - 11/2** - The server part of code is completed to the specifications and performs as designed
5. **Client Completed - 11/9** - The client part of code is completed to the specification and performs as designed
6. **Testing - 11/16** - The client and server connect and talk to each other as expected. And test the project that could run successful and get the result as we designed. 
7. **Fixing - 11/23** - Fix all the bugs that were found and change details if there are parts that are unreasonable. 
8. **Project Due - 12/4** - Project would be examined and perfected which including documentations, coding and testing. The project is due December 5th 8am.
